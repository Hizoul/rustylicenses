# yals
(y)et (a)nother (l)icense (s)canner is a KISS CLI utility to generate a license report of a `node_modules` directory.

## Quick Start
[Download a release here](https://github.com/hizoul/yals/releases). Then run in the directory of your JavaScript application.
```sh
yals ./node_modules
```

## What it does
yals scans through your `node_modules` directory to summarize the `name`, `repository` and `license` field from the `package.json`.

## Example Report
You can look at [OptiKey-BoardLayout's](https://github.com/Hizoul/optikey-boardlayout/blob/master/LICENSE.3rdparty) report generated by yals.

## Why not one of the existing ones?
- fossa licenses generates its report using a proprietary backend that also produces this error for me
```
WARNING Could not get OrganizationID while constructing locator
ERROR Unable to find licenses for project custom+$<redacted>:: could not send API HTTP request: Get https://app.fossa.com/api/revisions/custom+%!F(MISSING)$<redacted>/dependencies?generate_attribution=true&include_license_text=true: unexpected EOF
```
- ScanCode requries various setup steps / doesn't feature a simple binary one can just run
